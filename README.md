Interpretation:
1. Based on the length of stay, it can be seen that the cancellation rate of hotel bookings tends to increase as the length of stay increases, both in City Hotel and Resort Hotel. In particular, City Hotel experienced a higher increase in the cancellation rate. The highest trend for city hotels is at 4 weeks stay duration (87.23%) and resort hotels at 3 weeks stay duration (47.02%).
2. The reason behind the increase in cancellations with longer stay duration requires further evaluation and analysis by the company. There are many possibilities of how this could happen, it could be due to human error when customers make hotel reservations or their long vacation plans are canceled due to urgent reasons that they cannot refuse.
3.A business recommendation could be to implement a deposit or partial payment policy when a customer makes a booking to encourage more thoughtful decision-making when considering a cancellation. In addition, a policy can be created that restricts cancellation of bookings when the current date is close to the booking date.

Interpretation:
Long lead times allow for higher booking cancellation rates. Lead time is the difference between the day of booking and the arrival date.
1. Both city hotels and resort hotels show the lowest cancellation rates for lead times of one month or less, with City Hotel at 22.47% and Resort Hotel at 13.11%.
2.Both hotels show the highest cancellation rates for lead times of 11-12 months and more than 12 months, with City Hotel at 77.41% and Resort Hotel at 43.5%.
This could be due to customers' vacation plans being canceled or customers forgetting their hotel booking when the lead time is too long. To reduce cancellations, hotels can send reminders to customers and implement a strict cancellation policy for all reservations to minimize orderÂ cancellations.
